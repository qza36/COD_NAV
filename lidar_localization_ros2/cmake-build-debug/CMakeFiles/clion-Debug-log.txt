CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findndt_omp_ros2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ndt_omp_ros2" with
  any of the following names:

    ndt_omp_ros2Config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ndt_omp_ros2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ndt_omp_ros2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ndt_omp_ros2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
